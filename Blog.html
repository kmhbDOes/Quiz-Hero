            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>.map()</b> is a lot like .forEach(), but it very helpfully creates and returns a new
                array as the
                below
                example shows: <br>
                <code class="text-red-700">const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; <br>               
                const doubledNums = nums.map((num) => {
                return num * 2;
                }); <br>
                console.log(doubledNums);</code>
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>.filter()</b> method allows users to filter data. In JavaScript, it
                provides a means to filter values through an array,
                iterating over the values; that exist within a variable. It returns only those values that meet specific
                criteria into a
                new JS array. <br>
                <code class="text-red-700">let num = [3, 6, 7, 12, 18, 23, 44, 62, 81]; <br>
                
                let even_num = num.filter(function(item){ <br>
                
                return item % 2 == 0; }); <br>
                
                console.log(even_num);<br>
            Output: [6, 12, 18, 44, 62]
        </code>
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>.forEach()</b> array method loops over the array, passing each item in the array
                into the callback function provided. Unlike a regular for loop, .forEach() method does not provide a way
                to terminate iteration before all elements have been passed to the function. <br>
                <code class="text-red-700">Finding the sum of an array:
                
                const values = [7, 17, 34, 41, 22, 5]; <br>
                let sumOfValues = 0; <br>
                 
                values.forEach((value) => (sumOfValues += value)); <br>
                
                console.log(sumOfValues); <br>
                Output: 126 </code>

            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>.find()</b> method works on a given condition. Doesn't alter the original array <br>

            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>Cookies Storage:</b> Cookies are small text files that websites can store on a
                user's computer. They are often used to store user
                preferences, login credentials, and other data that needs to persist across multiple visits to a
                website. Cookies have
                an expiration date and time, and they can be set to expire when the user closes their browser or after a
                certain number
                of days.
            </p> <br>
            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>Session Storage:</b> Session Storage is a storage mechanism that allows web
                applications to store data during a user's session. Session data
                is stored on the client side and is only accessible within the same browser tab or window. Once the user
                closes the tab
                or window, the session data is deleted.
            </p> <br>
            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>Local Storage:</b> Local Storage is a storage mechanism that allows
                web applications to store data persistently on a user's
                computer. Data stored in local storage is not deleted when the user closes their browser or shuts down
                their computer.
                Local Storage is accessible across different tabs and windows, and even across different browser
                sessions.

            <h1 class="text-3xl">3.What is event loop and how does it work?</h1>
            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>Event Loop:</b> is a mechanism in JavaScript that manages the execution of
                asynchronous code by allowing the program to
                perform other tasks while waiting for a long-running operation to complete. It works by continuously
                checking a queue of
                tasks, and executing the next task in the queue when the current task is finished. Here's an example of
                it<br>
                <code class="text-red-700">console.log('start'); <br>               
                setTimeout(() => { <br>
                console.log("Async Task"); <br>
                }, 2000); <br>
            console.log('end'); <br></code>
                In this code, we first log "start" to the console, then schedule an asynchronous task using the
                setTimeout() function.
                This function takes a callback function and a time delay in milliseconds as arguments, and schedules the
                callback to be
                executed after the specified delay. In this case, we're scheduling the callback to be executed after a
                2-second delay.

                After scheduling the asynchronous task, we log "end" to the console. When we run this code, we'll see
                "start" and "end"
                logged to the console immediately, and then the program will wait for 2 seconds before logging "Async
                Task" to the
                console. This is because the setTimeout() function schedules the callback to be executed asynchronously,
                meaning that it
                will be added to the event queue and executed only when the current task (logging "end") is finished.

            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>quizTimer():</b> This function creates a timer for quiz when start quiz button is
                clicked. Takes boolean arguments named dismiss, If it's true then clears the timer and returns nothing.
                Otherwise setInterval() timer executes the function with 1 interval. If the count variable reaches 60
                seconds or more, the code alternates between adding and removing CSS classes on the
                "count" element to create a flashing effect.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 py-2"><b>chooseQuiz()():</b> This function has two arguments which are called when user is
                answering questions. Where <em>index</em> denoting which question is user answering and givenAns is
                about which answer is user picking. The function first checks whether the user has already answered the
                current question by searching through an array
                called answers. If the user has already answered the question, the function updates the existing answer
                with the new
                one. If the user has not answered the question before, the function adds a new object to the answers
                array with the
                details of the question and the answer. At final stage this function calls displayAnswers() function to
                update the UI with answers.
